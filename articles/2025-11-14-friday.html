    <article>

      <p><strong>Equities drifted into Friday with mixed sentiment as rates stabilized, oil slipped below $58, and the tape showed signs of late-week exhaustion.</strong> The CPI relief rally from earlier this month has fully faded, and what’s left is a market struggling to find direction as leadership narrows and liquidity thins into the close. Tech couldn’t retake early gains, cyclicals held up but lacked conviction, and flows were light outside of a few earnings-driven movers. Nothing broke — but buyers didn’t press, and the market traded like it knew the weekend was coming.</p>

      <h3>Index Performance & Sector Moves</h3>

      <p><strong>Index performance was choppy but controlled</strong>, with the S&amp;P finishing slightly red, the Nasdaq unable to reclaim early strength, and the Dow once again holding up better than growth-heavy peers. It wasn’t a panic-type tape — it was a slow fade, driven more by a lack of buyers than active selling.</p>

      <p><strong>Sector flows told the real story.</strong> Mega-cap tech looked tired, semis cooled after an extended run, and software lagged on weak follow-through after earnings. Meanwhile, <strong>value and cyclicals held the line</strong>, with industrials and financials seeing steady rotation as investors positioned for a slower but still resilient economic backdrop. Energy underperformed as crude broke below $58, and defensives traded flat, offering neither downside protection nor upside interest.</p>

      <p>This wasn’t a “trend day.” It was a <strong>positioning day</strong> — the kind of tape where traders square up, not press bets.</p>

      <h3>Rates, Dollar, Oil &amp; Cross-Asset Signals</h3>

      <p><strong>Rates stabilized</strong> in the back half of the week, with the 10-year holding near ~4.1% and failing to break lower despite softer inflation signals. That’s a subtle but important tell: the bond market is no longer chasing the disinflation narrative, and the Fed’s higher-for-longer stance still has teeth.</p>

      <p>The dollar drifted but held support levels — a wait-and-see posture from FX desks that kept cross-asset volatility contained.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <strong>oil slipped below $58</strong> on supply builds and cooling demand assumptions, weighing on energy and capping upside attempts from value names. Gold held steady, crypto chopped, and cross-asset markets collectively pointed to the same theme: <strong>risk appetite is cooling, not collapsing.</strong></p>

      <h3>Earnings Movers</h3>

      <p>Earnings didn’t move the entire market, but <strong>single-name reactions mattered.</strong> Companies that beat were barely rewarded, while misses saw exaggerated downside — a classic late-cycle tell. Retail was mixed, with margin-compression stories seeing the hardest hits. In tech, reactions were muted as macro remained the dominant driver of sentiment.</p>

      <p>Overall, good news felt priced in, while bad news still carried asymmetry to the downside.</p>

      <h3>Market Sentiment &amp; Positioning</h3>

      <p><strong>Positioning is no longer stretched bullish, but it’s nowhere near washed out.</strong> Options markets were quiet into the close, with traders avoiding unnecessary exposure into the weekend. Dealers stayed neutral, leaving the tape vulnerable to pockets of volatility but not set up for a major squeeze or cascade.</p>

      <p>The best summary of sentiment heard on desks today: <strong>“We’re tired, not scared.”</strong></p>

      <h3>How This Sets Up Next Week</h3>

      <p>Heading into next week, the setup remains balanced. Bears lack momentum, bulls lack catalysts, and the market is waiting for a driver — either macro or earnings — to break the range.</p>

      <p>The cooling in oil, stabilization in yields, and rotation into value all suggest a <strong>functional but slowing backdrop</strong>. Meanwhile, narrow equity leadership and fading tech strength point to exhaustion at the top of the market.</p>

      <p>Without major data early next week, expect <strong>range-bound trade</strong> and reaction-driven flows. A breakout requires fresh macro fuel; a breakdown requires a real shock. Right now, neither is visible.</p>
