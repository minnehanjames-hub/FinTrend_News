    <h1>Friday Market Recap — November 21, 2025</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      By <strong>James Minnehan</strong> · FinTrend News · Friday Market Recap
    </div>

    <p>
      The week ended the way it traded: not with a dramatic break, but with a slow
      loss of momentum and a tape that feels heavy without being outright bearish.
      Index levels don’t look alarming on the surface, but leadership continues to
      narrow and more of the upside is coming from rotation than from fresh risk-on
      appetite.
    </p>

    <h2>1. How the Week Traded vs. Monday’s Outlook</h2>
    <p>
      Coming into Monday, the setup was a stretched market with the soft-landing
      narrative intact but fading, and a Dow-led tape starting to replace the
      mega-cap-only rally. That’s largely what played out. Dip-buying still showed
      up on the first down days, but each bounce was shallower, and intraday
      reversals became more common as the week went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main takeaway: the market respected support, but there was very little
      urgency to push into new highs. That’s late-cycle behavior, not a fresh leg
      of a bull market.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Index and Sector Performance: Winners and Laggards</h2>
    <p>
      Index moves stayed in a relatively tight band, but the dispersion beneath the
      surface was where the real story sat:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Value and cyclicals</strong> (industrials, select financials) outperformed on
        quiet days, helped by stable rates and still-decent macro data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mega-cap tech</strong> remained positive on a multi-week basis but failed to
        extend leadership; some of the prior “safe momentum” names traded more
        like funding sources than must-own risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Defensive sectors</strong> (staples, utilities) saw only modest inflows — a key
        sign that we’re not yet in a full de-risking phase.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Energy</strong> tried to stabilize after recent weakness in crude but never
        developed a clean trend, leaving the sector more of a trading vehicle than
        a directional call.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This combination — value rotation without panic in defensives — fits a
      “late, but not done” cyclical environment rather than a sharp turn lower.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Rates, Dollar, and Cross-Asset Signals</h2>
    <p>
      Rates spent most of the week in a contained range, with the 10-year moving
      enough to influence sector preferences but not enough to force a wholesale
      repricing of risk. The market continues to price more easing than policymakers
      are explicitly guiding toward, but there was no single shock that forced a
      rethink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dollar drifted more than it trended, and commodities traded on
      idiosyncratic stories: energy on supply headlines, metals on growth and
      China-related sentiment. Cross-asset correlations stayed relatively low —
      another sign that this is a grind-down in momentum, not a correlated
      de-risking episode.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Positioning and Flows: No Forced Selling, But Less FOMO</h2>
    <p>
      Flow data and positioning suggest a market that is still long, but no longer
      chasing. Systematic strategies remain engaged, but not at max exposure.
      Hedge funds have trimmed some of the highest-beta names and rotated into
      steadier balance-sheet stories without fully abandoning tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Options flows reflect a similar mood: some interest in downside protection,
      but not the kind of panic hedging you see when investors are genuinely
      afraid of a gap-down event. The vol surface is more “cautious” than
      “terrified.”
    </p>

    <h2>5. What This Week Sets Up for Next Week</h2>
    <p>
      Heading into next week, the tape is finely balanced. On the one hand,
      stretched valuations, lagging breadth, and a tired leadership profile leave
      the market vulnerable to a negative macro or earnings surprise. On the
      other, there is still dry powder on the sidelines and no obvious catalyst
      forcing investors to abandon the soft-landing script.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key variables remain:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whether incoming data on the consumer and labor market confirm a gentle
        cooling or hint at something sharper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether the 10-year yield resolves higher or lower out of its current
        range, forcing a re-rating of equity risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether mega-cap tech can stabilize and act as a floor, or whether it
        becomes the source of further de-risking.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      This was a week where the market quietly aged a little: less momentum, more
      rotation, and a growing sense that the easy part of the rally is behind it.
      For now, the path of least resistance remains sideways with a slight
      downside skew, unless a new catalyst emerges to either re-ignite risk
      appetite or decisively break support.
