    <p>
      Midway through the week, markets are sending mixed but important signals.
      The early-week softness in mega-cap tech has not turned into a broader selloff,
      but the leadership rotation that began last week is continuing. Beneath the surface,
      sector dispersion is widening, macro sensitivity is increasing, and investors are
      becoming more selective as they digest economic data and earnings crosscurrents.
    </p>

    <h2>Where We Stand Since Monday</h2>

    <p>
      The S&P 500 is roughly flat on the week, trading slightly above 6800, while the
      Nasdaq has slipped modestly as profit-taking continues in high-valuation software
      and semiconductor names. The Dow remains the relative outperformer, supported by
      strength in industrials, healthcare, and financials.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 10-year yield is holding near 4.1%, keeping a lid on high-duration assets.
      Markets aren’t panicking — but they’re no longer euphoric.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      Price action confirms a shift from broad speculative risk-on to a more balanced,
      fundamentals-driven environment. The rally is not breaking, but the leadership
      baton has clearly passed from growth to value.
    </p>

    <h2>Sector Rotation & Factor Trends</h2>

    <p>
      The key story of the week is sector rotation. Cyclicals and value sectors —
      industrials, financials, and energy — continue to see inflows, while technology,
      communication services, and consumer discretionary show fatigue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Small caps remain mixed: some strength in industrial small caps is offset by
      weakness in unprofitable tech and biotech.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      “This is classic late-cycle positioning — investors want earnings visibility,
      strong balance sheets, and reasonable valuations.”
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      As long as rates remain stable, rotation benefits value-heavy indices (Dow, equal
      weight S&P) while capping upside in the Nasdaq.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Earnings Reactions</h2>

    <p>
      A few mid-cap earnings reports this week have produced outsized individual moves.
      High-quality companies with steady demand and disciplined cost control are being
      rewarded, while firms showing margin compression or soft volume guidance are being
      aggressively repriced.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      Stock-specific volatility remains high — a sign that investors are dissecting
      fundamentals more closely as the index rally matures.
    </p>

    <h2>Macro Data So Far</h2>

    <p>
      Early-week manufacturing data came in mixed, showing stabilization in some regions
      but continued contraction in others. Inflation indicators are not flashing alarms,
      but they are not cooling fast enough to fully relax markets, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      This keeps the “soft landing but fragile” narrative intact and increases the
      importance of the next set of consumer and pricing data.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup for the Rest of the Week</h2>

    <p>
      Investors are watching retail sales, producer prices, and several notable corporate
      guidance updates. If these come in stable to slightly soft, risk appetite should
      hold. If any single release surprises meaningfully to the upside or downside, the
      market response will likely be sharper than usual given stretched valuations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If data comes in hotter:</strong> yields rise and growth stocks lag.  
      <strong>If data comes in cooler:</strong> defensives and long-duration assets gain.  
      <strong>If earnings guidance disappoints:</strong> expect accelerated rotation into quality.
