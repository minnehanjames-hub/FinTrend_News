    <h1>Wednesday Momentum — February 4, 2026</h1>
    <div class="meta">By <strong>William Hunter Lang</strong> · FinTrend News · Momentum</div>

    <p>Midweek trade is being pulled in two directions: mega-cap tech is still dictating the index tape, while under the surface small caps and cyclicals are finally showing signs of life as earnings breadth improves.[web:11][web:13][web:19] At the same time, markets are bracing for back-to-back central bank decisions in Europe and the UK that could quietly reset how far and how fast rate cuts are expected later this year.[web:6][web:17]</p>

    <h2>1. Momentum Is Rotating, Not Reversing</h2>
    <p>The Q4 earnings season has confirmed that the profit cycle is intact, with S&P 500 earnings up roughly low double digits and revenue growth running near the high single digits — the tenth straight quarter of earnings growth and the twenty-first for revenue.[web:13] What has changed is who is driving that growth: information technology is still leading, but industrials and communication services are catching up, and smaller companies have started to outperform after lagging through most of 2025.[web:13][web:19]</p>
    <p>For momentum traders, that means index strength can be misleading: the “AI complex” and platform names still command the headlines, but flows are gradually diversifying into balance-sheet-strong cyclicals and select small caps with cleaner leverage and earnings trajectories.[web:13][web:19] In practice, that favors systematic strategies that look at breadth and factor behavior, rather than simply chasing the prior week’s largest winners.[web:13][web:19]</p>

    <h2>2. Earnings: Capex vs. Cash Flow</h2>
    <p>On the single-name side, mega-cap tech prints have landed mostly above the line on revenue and EPS, but guidance is increasingly dominated by AI-related capital expenditure and infrastructure plans.[web:11][web:16] Companies like Microsoft, Meta, and others are being pushed to spell out how much of the next few years’ cash generation will be reinvested into data centers, chips, and software rather than returned via buybacks and dividends.[web:11][web:16]</p>
    <p>That tension is shaping price action: solid beats are not enough if management also signals a multi-year step-up in capex without offering a clear payback profile in margins or free cash flow.[web:11][web:16] Conversely, companies that can pair credible AI narratives with demonstrable operating leverage — such as improving software and infrastructure margins or better ad monetization — are seeing post-earnings follow-through rather than one-day pops.[web:11][web:13][web:16]</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="tile">
        <div class="k">Momentum Support Drivers</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Blended S&P 500 earnings growth near 12% with positive guidance for Q1 and full-year 2026.[web:13]</li>
          <li>Information technology, industrials, and communication services all posting double‑digit earnings gains.[web:13]</li>
          <li>Small caps and cyclicals outperforming as investors look beyond a narrow set of mega-caps.[web:13][web:19]</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="tile">
        <div class="k">Emerging Friction Points</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Mega-cap tech facing “good news, tough reaction” as AI capex weighs on cash-flow expectations.[web:11][web:16]</li>
          <li>Higher sensitivity to guidance, with soft outlooks punished even when reported numbers beat.[web:11][web:16][web:19]</li>
          <li>Upcoming labor-market and JOLTS data that could re-open the debate about how quickly central banks can cut.[web:12]</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Central Banks: Signaling Phase, Not Pivot</h2>
    <p>The European Central Bank’s February meeting is set to keep rates on hold again, with officials emphasizing that inflation is converging toward 2% and that earlier cuts, resilient labor markets, and new public spending are supporting growth.[web:6][web:14] The nuance is that the ECB is clearly in a signaling phase: it wants to acknowledge progress on disinflation without committing to a fixed path for future cuts, keeping decisions explicitly data-dependent from meeting to meeting.[web:6][web:14]</p>
    <p>Across the Channel, the Bank of England has just delivered a surprisingly close 5–4 vote to keep Bank Rate at 3.75%, with four members pushing for an immediate 25 basis point cut.[web:17] Markets read that split as confirmation that the BoE is inching toward easing, and rate expectations for a March cut jumped from around one-in-five odds to nearly a coin flip, which in turn supports UK duration and risk assets sensitive to domestic borrowing costs.[web:17]</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Why the next 48 hours matter</summary>
      <p>The combination of dense labor-market data in the U.S., a cautious but more dovish‑leaning BoE, and an ECB that is “on hold but watching the data” will shape how far bond yields can drift lower without reawakening inflation worries.[web:6][web:12][web:17] If yields stay contained and earnings breadth holds, momentum can keep rotating rather than breaking; if data surprise hotter or central banks push back on cuts, expect leadership to narrow again and the weakest balance sheets to reprice first.[web:12][web:13][web:17]</p>
