<h1>Friday Market Recap — December 12</h1>

<p>
Markets closed the week steady on the surface, but beneath the headlines it was another reminder
that rates remain the primary driver of risk sentiment. Equity dips were shallow, volatility stayed
suppressed, and positioning continued to lean toward a year-end grind higher.
</p>

<h2>What mattered this week</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rates:</strong> Treasury yields remained the dominant signal. Every uptick pressured equities at the margin.</li>
  <li><strong>Equities:</strong> Indexes held up, but leadership narrowed — strength was selective rather than broad.</li>
  <li><strong>FX:</strong> The dollar traded more on rate differentials than macro fear.</li>
  <li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Oil and gold stayed range-bound, acting as macro hedges rather than trend trades.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
This remains a market that wants to stay long risk, but it’s priced tightly. Good data is no longer
automatically bullish if it pushes yields higher. The margin for error is thinner than the tape suggests.
</p>

<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>
Into next week, watch rates and breadth closely. If yields stay contained, pullbacks remain buyable.
If not, even small shocks can travel faster through a crowded positioning backdrop.
