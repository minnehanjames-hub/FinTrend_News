    <h1>Minutes, Nvidia, and the Weight of 6,900</h1>
    <div class="meta">By <strong>William Hunter Lang</strong> · FinTrend News · Wednesday, February 18, 2026</div>

    <!-- Executive Summary -->
    <div class="exec-summary">
      <div class="k">Executive Summary</div>
      <p>Markets are staging a cautious tech-led recovery after last week's AI-driven selloff, but the real decision point arrives today at 2pm ET when the Fed releases January FOMC minutes — and again Friday when PCE data either validates or resets the dovish rate-cut narrative building in bonds.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Driver -->
    <h2>Driver</h2>
    <p>The primary driver today is <strong>the FOMC minutes dropping at 2pm ET</strong>, and a market that still doesn't know what to make of them. Rate-cut expectations have been quietly rebuilding in the bond market since the AI disruption selloff last week — the 10-year is sitting near two-month lows just above 4%, and the implied June cut probability is back above 90% on CME FedWatch. But equities haven't fully committed to that story. Three consecutive sessions of late-day fade say as much.</p>
    <p>Layered on top: Nvidia is up 2% on an expanded Meta AI chip deal, giving tech a tactical bid and raising the question of whether last week's DeepSeek-adjacent anxiety has actually been digested or is just temporarily shelved. The answer probably comes from the Fed this afternoon, not from one chip contract.</p>

    <div class="alert">
      <div class="k">What's Moving Today</div>
      <p>Nvidia +2.03%, Goldman Sachs +2.89%, Amazon +1.85% are leading a broad advance. About 350 S&amp;P 500 components are participating — healthy breadth on the surface. But AMD is -4% and Palo Alto Networks is down 10% after earnings, a reminder that stock-level dispersion is still elevated and the AI narrative is in repair mode, not recovery mode.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Confirmation -->
    <h2>Confirmation</h2>
    <p>The tape is broadening under the surface, even as the index remains choppy and well below January's 7,000 high. The 10-year yield hovering above 4% — near a two-month low — is quietly easing financial conditions without triggering a reflexive re-tightening. The VIX is still above 20 but declining today, suggesting caution rather than panic. And the Russell 2000 is outperforming the Nasdaq by a meaningful margin, with small caps up 1.2% — consistent with a genuine rotation rather than a dead-cat bounce in mega-cap names.</p>
    <p>The catch is that confirmation has a short shelf life at the moment. Every afternoon this week has seen the rally fade into the close. Institutional sellers are not done distributing, and breadth expansion into financials and small caps — while structurally healthy — hasn't been enough to push the index back toward 6,950, let alone 7,000.</p>

    <!-- Market Bias -->
    <h2>Market Bias</h2>
    <span class="bias-badge">Rotation / Range-Bound</span>
    <p style="margin-top:14px;">The market is no longer in outright rejection, but it hasn't earned acceptance above 7,000 either. What's happening looks like sector rotation playing out inside a constrained index range: tech digesting recent weakness while energy, financials, and small caps absorb the freed-up capital. The problem is that without a macro catalyst — specifically, a Fed minutes release that clears the air on the rate timeline — the index is likely to stay pinned between 6,840 and 6,950 through the afternoon. That range holds until something breaks it.</p>

    <!-- Catalyst Watch -->
    <h2>Catalyst Watch</h2>

    <div class="panel">
      <div class="k">Events That Can Move the Tape</div>
      <p><strong>Today — FOMC Minutes at 2pm ET:</strong> The market is pricing roughly two rate cuts in 2026, with the first expected around June. If today's minutes show deep division around tariff-driven inflation — particularly language treating it as structural rather than transitory — the June timeline gets pushed out and yields rebound from their two-month lows. If the minutes reveal broad acknowledgment that disinflation is intact and the economy is near neutral, the dovish bond trade strengthens and equities finally get the catalyst to close strong for the first time all week.</p>
      <p><strong>Tomorrow — Walmart Earnings:</strong> A real-economy pulse check on the consumer. After General Mills cut its full-year forecast last week citing active spending pullback, Walmart's tone on the low-to-middle income shopper will either confirm or complicate the tariff-pass-through narrative building in discretionary stocks.</p>
      <p><strong>Friday — PCE Inflation + Q4 GDP Advance Estimate:</strong> PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. A soft print here — particularly on the core side — closes the loop on Tuesday's cooler CPI reading and gives the June cut pricing a durable foundation. A surprise to the upside reopens the hawkish scenario the bond market has been dismissing all week.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Risk Scenario -->
    <h2>Risk Scenario</h2>
    <div class="risk-panel">
      <div class="k">Risks to This View</div>
      <p>The downside risk is hawkish minutes — specifically, FOMC language revealing more internal disagreement around tariff-driven inflation than the market expects. That snaps the 10-year back above 4.2%, reprices June cut odds lower, and puts the 6,843 support level under immediate pressure heading into the Walmart print tomorrow. The upside risk is the reverse: a dovish minutes surprise paired with soft PCE Friday compresses yields meaningfully, triggers a squeeze through 7,000, and makes the current rotation trade disorderly — growth and rate-sensitive names both spike simultaneously, and positioning gets messy fast.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Closing -->
    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <div class="closing">
      For now, momentum favors selective positioning and patience. The breadth expansion into small caps and financials is real, but the ceiling holds until the Fed gives it permission to move. Watch 2pm ET for the minutes, watch 6,950 on SPX as the tell for the afternoon session, and keep one eye on Friday's PCE — that's the macro print that decides whether this week becomes the start of a genuine recovery or just another false dawn below 7,000.
