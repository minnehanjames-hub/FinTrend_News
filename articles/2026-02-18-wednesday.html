    <div class="badge">Macro Setup · Fed Minutes + AI Rotation + PCE Friday</div>

    <h1>Minutes, Nvidia, and the Weight of 6,900</h1>
    <div class="meta">By <strong>William Hunter Lang</strong> · FinTrend News · February 18, 2026</div>

    <h2>1️⃣ Headline (Clear + Positioning)</h2>
    <p><strong>Minutes, Nvidia, and the Weight of 6,900</strong></p>

    <h2>2️⃣ 1-Sentence Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Markets are staging a cautious tech-led recovery after last week's AI-driven selloff, but the real decision point arrives today at 2pm ET when the Fed releases January FOMC minutes — and again Friday when PCE data either validates or resets the dovish rate-cut narrative building in bonds.</p>

    <h2>3️⃣ Driver</h2>
    <p>The primary driver today is <strong>the release of January FOMC meeting minutes at 2pm ET</strong>, which is impacting <strong>rate-cut expectations and equity multiples</strong> through <strong>a market searching for clarity on whether the Fed's pause is a brief hold or a prolonged freeze</strong>. Layered on top: Nvidia's 2%+ move on an expanded Meta AI chip deal is giving tech a tactical bid and testing whether last week's AI disruption fears have been fully digested.</p>

    <h2>4️⃣ Confirmation</h2>
    <p>Confirmation appears through <strong>10-year Treasury yields drifting near two-month lows just above 4%, the VIX holding above 20 but pulling back from recent highs, and nearly 350 S&amp;P 500 components advancing today</strong>, suggesting that <strong>the tape is broadening under the surface even as the index itself remains choppy and below last month's 7,000 high-water mark</strong>. Three straight sessions of late-day rally fade, however, signal a market that lacks conviction on the upside without a macro catalyst.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="tile">
        <div class="k">What Confirmed It</div>
        <ul>
          <li>10-year yield hovering just above 4% — near two-month lows — quietly easing financial conditions.</li>
          <li>Nvidia +2%, Amazon +1.85%, Goldman Sachs +2.89% leading a broad advance across ~350 S&amp;P names.</li>
          <li>VIX above 20 but declining today — cautious, not panicked.</li>
          <li>Russell 2000 +1.2% — small caps outperforming, consistent with rotation away from mega-cap dependency.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="tile">
        <div class="k">What It Implies</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower yields are providing equity support, but 3 consecutive sessions of fading rallies suggest institutional sellers are not done distributing.</li>
          <li>Breadth expansion into small caps and financials is structurally healthy but not yet enough to reclaim 7,000.</li>
          <li>AI narrative is in repair mode, not recovery mode — one chip deal is not a thesis reset.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>5️⃣ Market Bias</h2>
    <p><strong>Rotation / Range-bound.</strong> The market is no longer in outright rejection, but it hasn't earned acceptance above 7,000 either. The current setup looks like a sector rotation story playing out inside a constrained index range: tech digesting recent weakness while energy, financials, and small caps pick up relative slack. Until the Fed minutes and Friday's PCE give rates a clear direction, the index is likely to remain anchored between 6,840–6,950.</p>

    <h2>6️⃣ Key Levels</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="tile">
        <div class="k">SPX</div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Support:</strong> 6,843 (Tuesday close / recent floor after last week's sharp drop)</li>
          <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> 6,950–7,000 (late-day rejection zone / prior acceptance ceiling)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="tile">
        <div class="k">NDX</div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Support:</strong> 24,800 (post-selloff base; loss of this level accelerates tech unwinding)</li>
          <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> 25,500–26,000 (overhead supply from the AI disruption breakdown zone)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>7️⃣ Catalyst Watch</h2>
    <p>The next potential inflection point is <strong>today's FOMC minutes release at 2pm ET</strong>, followed closely by <strong>Friday's PCE inflation data and Q4 GDP advance estimate</strong>. If minutes signal the Fed is genuinely data-dependent and open to cuts in summer, yields can sustain their drift lower and give equities room. If the minutes lean hawkish — particularly on tariff-driven inflation risks — front-end rates reprice higher and the 6,950 ceiling holds firm. Walmart earnings tomorrow also matter as a real-economy pulse check on the consumer.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>How to read the Fed minutes through today's tape</summary>
      <p>The market is currently pricing roughly two rate cuts in 2026, with the first expected around June — consistent with CME FedWatch's 90%+ probability of a hold in March. If today's minutes show deep division inside the FOMC about the inflation outlook (especially tariff-related price pressures), that June timeline gets pushed out and yields rebound from their two-month lows. Conversely, if the minutes reveal broad acknowledgment that the economy is near neutral and disinflation is intact, the dovish trade in bonds strengthens — and the equity rally that's been fading every afternoon finally gets a catalyst to close strong.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>8️⃣ Risk Scenario</h2>
    <p>The risk to this view would be <strong>FOMC minutes that reveal more hawkish internal deliberation than expected</strong>, reinforcing the Fed's tariff-inflation concern and repricing the June cut probability lower — which would snap the 10-year yield back above 4.2% and put the 6,843 support level under immediate pressure. The opposite risk is <strong>a dovish minutes surprise combined with a soft PCE Friday</strong>, which could compress yields meaningfully, trigger a squeeze through 7,000, and pull forward cut expectations — making the current rotation trade far less orderly as growth and rate-sensitive names both spike simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>9️⃣ Closing Tone</h2>
    <p>For now, momentum favors <strong>selective positioning and patience</strong>. The breadth expansion into small caps and financials is real, but the index ceiling holds until the Fed gives it permission to move. Watch <strong>2pm ET for the minutes, 6,950 on SPX as the tell for the afternoon session</strong>, and keep one eye on Friday's PCE — that's the macro print that decides whether this week becomes the start of a genuine recovery or just another false dawn below 7,000.</p>
