    <p>
      The tape is behaving exactly like a pre–Thanksgiving session: liquidity is thinning out,
      leadership is narrow, and most traders are more worried about travel than taking fresh
      risk. But “quiet” doesn’t mean meaningless — today’s flows are telling you where money
      is comfortable hiding into month-end and where patience is running out.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Tape: Low Liquidity, Clear Rotation</h2>
    <p>
      Volumes are running well below 20-day averages across the majors, but the pattern
      beneath the surface is consistent:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="inline-label">Mega-cap tech:</span> trading mixed, with buyers showing up
        on shallow dips but no appetite to chase breakouts into a holiday.</li>
      <li><span class="inline-label">Defensives:</span> staples, utilities, and healthcare are
        quietly outperforming, reflecting a “play it safe into month-end” mindset.</li>
      <li><span class="inline-label">Cyclicals:</span> industrials and financials are chopping
        sideways, tethered to the 10-year yield and year-end positioning rather than new
        information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The result is a market that feels stable on the surface but tired underneath — rallies
      stall quickly, and dips get bought, but nobody is pushing aggressively in either
      direction.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Volatility & Positioning: Comfortably Dull</h2>
    <p>
      Implied volatility remains subdued, and there’s little evidence of urgent hedging:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Index vol is pricing a calm, range-bound tape through the holiday window.</li>
      <li>Single-name skew is flatter, suggesting less demand for crash protection and more
        interest in yield-selling strategies.</li>
      <li>Dealer positioning still argues for a “gravity toward the middle” setup — intraday
        swings are being faded rather than extended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is classic holiday behavior: the path of least resistance is sideways to slightly up,
      unless an unexpected macro shock hits the tape.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What’s Actually Moving: Pockets of Momentum</h2>
    <p>
      Even in a sleepy tape, there are a few clear themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="inline-label">AI & semis:</span> still the cleanest upside momentum,
        with traders willing to add selectively on red days.</li>
      <li><span class="inline-label">Energy:</span> stabilizing after recent weakness, but flows
        are tentative — the market wants confirmation that crude has found a floor.</li>
      <li><span class="inline-label">Small caps:</span> fading after the latest bounce, as higher
        real yields and tighter financial conditions limit enthusiasm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These pockets matter because they show you where risk appetite still exists — and where
      traders will likely return once liquidity normalizes after the holiday.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Into the Holiday: How to Read the Next Few Sessions</h2>
    <p>
      The next 48 hours are less about “new information” and more about how the market reacts
      to the macro story it already knows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch whether dip-buying in leaders (AI, semis, quality growth) remains orderly.</li>
      <li>Track if defensives keep outperforming — that would confirm a slow rotation toward
        lower-beta exposure into year-end.</li>
      <li>Keep an eye on the 10-year yield — a move back toward recent highs would tighten
        financial conditions and pressure cyclicals again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      This is still a bull market with a tired engine: leadership is concentrated, liquidity
      is thin, and nobody wants to blow up a year’s worth of P&amp;L the day before a holiday.
      For active traders, the playbook is simple — respect the ranges, don’t overinterpret
      holiday tape, and use any overshoots as information about where capital wants to be
      positioned once full liquidity returns.
