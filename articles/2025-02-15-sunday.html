    <h1>Sunday Weekly Recap — February 15, 2026</h1>
    <div class="meta">By <strong>William Hunter Lang</strong> · FinTrend News · Weekly Macro Recap</div>

    <div class="headline">
      <div class="k">Week in One Line</div>
      <div class="b">Inflation cooled just enough to pull rate-cut expectations forward — but not enough to justify paying peak multiples for long-duration growth.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>U.S. CPI surprised modestly to the downside, pushing fed funds futures toward mid-year easing and flattening front-end term premia.</li>
      <li>The S&amp;P 500 held near record highs (~6,830), but leadership rotated away from megacap tech toward utilities and real estate.</li>
      <li>The 2-year yield eased toward ~3.5%, while the 10-year hovered near ~4.1%, keeping the curve positively sloped.</li>
      <li>European equities remained supported by policy stability; Asia weakened into holiday-thin liquidity.</li>
      <li>Gold rallied above $5,000 on falling real-rate expectations; oil stayed in the low-$60s (WTI), reflecting tempered growth assumptions.</li>
      <li>The dollar held firm on relative yield advantage despite softer U.S. inflation data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Equity Markets: Rotation Without Panic</h2>

    <p>For the week, U.S. equities did not break — but they did rotate. The S&amp;P 500 closed Friday near 6,836, the Nasdaq around 22,547, and the Dow near 49,500. The index-level calm masked a shift beneath the surface.</p>

    <p>The driver was January CPI. Headline inflation printed softer than consensus. That mechanically reduces near-term real yield expectations and increases the probability of policy easing. Normally that dynamic lifts the most rate-sensitive, longest-duration segments of the market.</p>

    <p>This time, it didn’t — at least not sustainably. Utilities and REITs outperformed. Megacap tech lagged. That tells you positioning was already extended in duration-sensitive growth. The CPI print removed a tail risk (re-acceleration in inflation), but it did not create new information about earnings power. Investors chose sectors where lower financing costs directly improve balance sheets rather than sectors where valuation relies heavily on distant cash flows.</p>

    <p>Europe was steady. The Stoxx 600 ended the week roughly flat near highs. The DAX (~24,900) and CAC (~8,300) held their gains. The FTSE 100 pushed above 10,400. Europe’s outperformance relative to U.S. growth stocks reflects two things: dividend yield support and less extreme positioning in long-duration assets.</p>

    <p>Asia was softer. Japan’s Nikkei (~56,900) consolidated after a strong run. Hong Kong and mainland China declined into extended holiday closures. Liquidity was thin, amplifying any spillover from U.S. tech hesitation.</p>

    <p>The broader takeaway: equities are not rejecting the easing narrative. They are demanding earnings visibility before extending multiples further.</p>

    <h2>2. Rates and Central Banks: Front-End Relief, Long-End Skepticism</h2>

    <p>The week belonged to the front end of the U.S. curve. Following CPI, fed funds futures increased the implied probability of a June rate cut and priced roughly 60 basis points of easing over 2026.</p>

    <p>The 2-year yield drifted toward the mid-3s (~3.5%), reflecting that repricing. The 10-year yield remained near ~4.1%. That left the curve positively sloped by roughly 50–60 basis points.</p>

    <p>This shape matters. A bull steepening driven by falling short rates usually implies easing expectations without growth reacceleration. If markets believed inflation was collapsing and growth about to re-ignite, the long end would rally more aggressively. It did not.</p>

    <p>The Federal Reserve now has room to wait. One softer inflation print lowers the urgency for further tightening but does not compel immediate cuts. The labor market remains firm. Until wage data confirms disinflation is broad-based, policymakers can tolerate markets pricing cuts without validating them.</p>

    <p>In Europe, the ECB maintained its steady tone. No urgency. No pivot signal. Policy stability has supported peripheral spreads and equity valuations, but without clear growth acceleration, Europe remains a carry-oriented allocation rather than a high-beta growth trade.</p>

    <h2>3. Currencies and Commodities: Real Yields Drive the Message</h2>

    <p>The dollar index (DXY) hovered near ~97. EUR/USD traded around ~1.18. USD/JPY remained above 153. Despite softer inflation, the dollar held because relative yields still favor the U.S. Even with easing priced, U.S. short rates remain well above those in Europe and Japan.</p>

    <p>Gold responded precisely to real-rate dynamics, rising back above $5,000 per ounce. When front-end yields fall and inflation expectations hold, real yields decline. Gold tends to track that relationship tightly. This week was no exception.</p>

    <p>Oil told a different story. WTI traded in the low $60s, Brent in the high $60s. Energy did not rally alongside gold. That divergence suggests the move was about rates rather than a broad improvement in growth expectations. Lower real rates support gold. Oil requires a stronger demand outlook. That remains absent.</p>

    <h2>4. Cross-Asset Implications: Selectivity Is Increasing</h2>

    <p>The cross-asset alignment is coherent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Front-end yields lower.</li>
      <li>Curve positive but not collapsing.</li>
      <li>Gold higher.</li>
      <li>Oil subdued.</li>
      <li>Equity leadership rotating defensive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is not a high-conviction growth regime. It is a “policy optionality” regime. Investors are willing to hold equities near highs, but they are shifting toward cash-flow durability.</p>

    <p>Importantly, this environment increases dispersion. Companies with elevated capex plans and unclear monetization timelines are facing a higher discount rate at the equity level — even if Treasury yields fall modestly. Markets are scrutinizing free cash flow, not narratives.</p>

    <p>Credit spreads remain contained, suggesting no systemic stress. But if yields were to reprice higher again, the most leveraged balance sheets would feel pressure quickly.</p>

    <h2>What to Watch Next</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fed messaging:</strong> Any pushback against mid-year easing expectations could quickly lift the 2-year yield.</li>
      <li><strong>U.S. wage data:</strong> Sustained moderation would validate the CPI signal; a reacceleration would challenge it.</li>
      <li><strong>Oil stability in the low $60s:</strong> Further weakness would imply demand softness.</li>
      <li><strong>Megacap earnings guidance updates:</strong> Investors want clarity on capex returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-holiday China trading:</strong> Thin liquidity has distorted price action; reopening flows will clarify sentiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The week reduced inflation risk but did not create growth enthusiasm. Markets are pricing policy relief without paying aggressively for distant earnings. Until either growth surprises higher or disinflation becomes more decisive, expect continued rotation toward balance-sheet resilience and cash-flow visibility.</p>
