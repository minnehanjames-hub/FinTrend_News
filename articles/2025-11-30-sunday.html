    <h1>Sunday Macro &amp; Positioning Note — November 30, 2025</h1>

    <div class="meta">
      By <strong>William Lang</strong> · FinTrend News · Sunday Macro Note
    </div>

    <p>
      Month-end finds global markets in a familiar but fragile place. The November
      rally has left major indices hovering near the upper end of their ranges,
      volatility suppressed, and positioning skewed toward a soft-landing narrative
      that now feels well owned. The question heading into December isn’t whether
      the tape can grind higher — it’s how much good news is already priced in.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Macro Backdrop at Month-End</h2>
    <p>
      Growth data through November continued to support the <em>“slowing, not
      stalling”</em> story. Manufacturing PMIs are still mixed but off their lows,
      services activity is cooling from elevated levels rather than rolling over,
      and labor markets show early signs of softening without a sharp spike in
      unemployment claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inflation has drifted lower, but the progress is uneven. Core measures are
      now decisively below their peaks, yet still above central-bank comfort zones.
      That keeps policy in a “higher-for-longer, but data dependent” posture rather
      than pivoting toward aggressive easing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Net result: the macro data justifies current levels, but doesn’t obviously
      argue for a new leg of multiple expansion on its own.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Changed Since Early November</h2>
    <p>
      Compared with the first half of the month, the key shift has been in
      <strong>how</strong> the market trades familiar headlines, not in the headlines
      themselves. Hot data no longer sparks a broad risk-off move; it triggers
      rotation. Soft data doesn’t crash indices; it reshuffles leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “everything rallies” phase of the year is behind us. In its place is a
      more selective tape where earnings quality, balance-sheet strength, and
      valuation discipline matter again. That’s classic late-cycle behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Positioning: Still Long, but Less One-Sided</h2>
    <p>
      Systematic and discretionary positioning has eased from the extremes seen
      after the October–early November squeeze, but it is still tilted long risk.
      CTAs are moderately exposed to equities, dealers are close to neutral, and
      hedge funds have rotated out of the highest-beta names into steadier
      cash-flow stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no sign of forced selling, but there is also less dry powder than
      there was three months ago. Incremental buying now needs fresh catalysts —
      cleaner disinflation, upside growth surprises, or a genuine shift in the
      policy trajectory.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sector &amp; Style Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      Leadership continues to broaden beyond mega-cap tech, but not in a straight
      line. Industrials, financials, and select energy names have quietly built
      relative strength, while software, speculative growth and unprofitable
      small-caps remain volatile around earnings and data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Factor-wise, investors are rewarding <strong>quality and balance sheets</strong>
      more than pure growth. Companies with pricing power, visible demand, and
      conservative leverage are being used as core holdings, while high-duration
      stories are treated as trading vehicles rather than destinations.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Key Risks Heading into December</h2>
    <p>
      Three risks dominate the month-ahead discussion:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Data surprises in either direction.</strong> A sharp re-acceleration in
      inflation would challenge the soft-landing narrative and push yields higher.
      Conversely, a sudden downshift in employment or spending would revive the
      hard-landing debate. Both scenarios argue for higher volatility from today’s
      low base.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Policy communication risk.</strong> Central-bank meetings and speeches
      in December will matter less for the immediate policy decision and more for
      the path implied for 2026. Any pushback against market-implied cuts could
      reprice the front end of the curve and spill into equity valuations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Liquidity and year-end flows.</strong> As December progresses, liquidity
      naturally thins and flows become more technical: tax-loss selling, window
      dressing, and risk-parity rebalancing can all exaggerate moves that would
      be modest in mid-year conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      November ends with markets priced for a gentle landing and a contained
      inflation path. That scenario is still plausible — but no longer contrarian.
      For the next few weeks, the risk/reward skew is less about chasing highs and
      more about managing the gap between expectations and reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here, the tape can still grind higher if data cooperate and policy
      remains predictable. But the bar for upside surprise is high, and the
      tolerance for disappointment is shrinking. December is likely to be driven
      less by new narratives and more by how existing ones survive real-volume
      trading and thinner year-end liquidity.
