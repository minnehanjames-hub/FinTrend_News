    <h1>Wednesday Momentum Check — November 26, 2025</h1>
    <div class="meta">By <strong>James Minnehan</strong> · FinTrend News · Momentum</div>

    <p>Thanksgiving week momentum is always a little deceptive. Price can drift on thin volume, leadership can look “clean,” and then one headline or one rate move flips the tape. So today is less about calling a breakout and more about mapping what’s actually driving the market under the surface.</p>

    <h2>1. The “Rates → AI → Index” Feedback Loop Is Still Running</h2>
    <p>Momentum remains concentrated in the same cluster: AI-linked mega-cap tech and comm services. When rate expectations tilt dovish, duration-sensitive growth catches an extra bid, and that bid feeds index-level strength. This week’s tone has been supported by rising confidence around a December rate cut narrative and a “bad news is good news” interpretation of softer data—an environment that tends to keep momentum strategies leaning long.</p>

    <h2>2. Liquidity Is the Hidden Volatility Input</h2>
    <p>Holiday weeks compress participation. That doesn’t guarantee volatility—until it does. In thin books, small flows travel further, which can exaggerate trend signals and make momentum look stronger than it is. This is why “quiet” sessions can still produce sharp intraday moves, even without a fundamental catalyst.</p>

    <h2>3. Watch the 10-Year Range: It’s the Real Momentum Trigger</h2>
    <p>Treasury yields have been consolidating in a narrow band, and that’s a big reason risk assets can levitate. A stable 10-year reduces the discount-rate shock that normally disrupts growth leadership. If yields break higher, momentum gets challenged first in the crowded winners; if yields drift lower, momentum broadens and “chase” behavior returns fast.</p>

    <h2>4. Buybacks Are a Tailwind Into Year-End</h2>
    <p>One of the most underappreciated supports for late-year momentum is corporate buyback execution. Research desks have highlighted that Nov–Dec are historically strong months for buyback flow. In thin holiday liquidity, buybacks can matter even more because they provide consistent demand while discretionary participation falls.</p>

    <h2>5. Momentum Risk: The Same Names Are Doing All the Work</h2>
    <p>The biggest momentum risk right now is not “bearish fundamentals”—it’s concentration. When the index is being carried by a narrow set of leaders, headline risk (Fed speak, inflation prints, geopolitics, or a single mega-cap miss) can produce a momentum air pocket. If you see breadth improving—especially outside the AI complex—that’s your signal the trend is healthier.</p>

    <h2>6. Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Momentum is still constructive, but it’s running on two inputs: stable/softening yields and concentrated AI leadership. In a holiday tape, don’t over-trust the smoothness of the trend. The move can remain upward—just be aware the path can change quickly when liquidity returns.</p>
