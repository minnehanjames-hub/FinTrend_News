        U.S. markets are closed for Presidents&rsquo; Day, but the cross-asset picture heading into this week tells a more interesting story than Friday&rsquo;s flat tape suggested. The 10-year yield sits at 4.04%, its lowest level since early December. The 2-year is at 3.40%, the lowest since 2022. The dollar index is below 97. Gold is above $5,000. And yet the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.4% last week, with the Nasdaq down 2.1%. Bonds are pricing in easier policy. Equities are not buying it.

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The S&amp;P 500 closed last week at 6,836 (-1.4%), with the Nasdaq off 2.1% and the Dow down 1.2%, despite a softer-than-expected January CPI print (2.4% YoY headline, below the 2.5% consensus).</li>
          <li>Treasury yields dropped across the curve &mdash; the 10-year fell 18 bps on the week to 4.04%, the 2-year fell to 3.40% &mdash; but equities did not follow. That divergence is the week&rsquo;s most important signal.</li>
          <li>The dollar index slid below 97 and is down over 2% against the yen, driven by Japan&rsquo;s post-Takaichi political momentum and verbal intervention from Tokyo.</li>
          <li>Gold surged past $5,000/oz, touching $5,070 intraweek, supported by lower real yields, central bank buying (China extended purchases for a 15th consecutive month), and geopolitical hedging around US-Iran negotiations.</li>
          <li>Brent crude steadied near $67.70/bbl and WTI at $62.80, held down by OPEC+ signals about resuming output increases in April, despite a 1.2 mb/d supply drop in January from North American winter disruptions.</li>
          <li>The ECB held rates at 2.0% on February 5 as eurozone CPI fell to 1.7% YoY &mdash; below target &mdash; raising questions about whether Europe is tightening by inaction while the disinflation trend accelerates.</li>
          <li>This week brings Walmart and Deere earnings, the Fed minutes from January, Q4 GDP revision, and &mdash; critically &mdash; the core PCE report on Friday. The last of these is the single most important data point before the March FOMC meeting.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>1 &middot; Equity Markets &mdash; Rates fell, stocks didn&rsquo;t follow</h2>
        <p>
          Friday&rsquo;s close was deceptively quiet. The S&amp;P 500 added 3 points (+0.05%), the Dow gained 49 points (+0.10%), and the Nasdaq slipped 50 points (-0.22%). Under the surface, the week was more disorderly than those numbers imply. The Nasdaq lost 2.1% over the five sessions despite a CPI report that, in prior cycles, would have been unambiguously bullish for duration-sensitive growth stocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The explanation lies in sector-level flows. Megacap tech continued to de-rate: Nvidia fell 2.2%, Apple 2.3%, Meta 1.6%, and Broadcom 1.8%. The common thread is not earnings disappointment &mdash; most of these names beat estimates last quarter &mdash; but a growing skepticism about the return profile of AI-related capital expenditure. When Applied Materials surged 8.1% and Arista Networks jumped 4.8% on earnings beats, the market was selectively rewarding companies with near-term cash flow visibility and punishing those relying on forward capex narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Salesforce and Oracle both gained 2.3%, and the Dow&rsquo;s relative outperformance over the Nasdaq reflects rotation away from high-beta growth toward old-economy and enterprise software names. This is defensive repositioning wearing a cyclical mask: investors are not adding risk, they are rearranging it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Europe, the picture is different. The STOXX 600 sits at 621, the DAX cleared 25,000, and the FTSE hit 10,386 &mdash; all near or at record levels. European banks are trading at their highest since 2008. The EU-India trade deal, the resolution of the Greenland tariff standoff, and a weaker euro through Q4 2025 all contributed. But the more structural driver is relative valuation: European equities trade at a 35-40% discount to U.S. counterparts on forward P/E, and capital is finally noticing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Asia, the Nikkei touched a fresh record near 57,650 on February 10 before pulling back to 56,931 on Friday. The &ldquo;Takaichi trade&rdquo; &mdash; the market bet that PM Takaichi&rsquo;s fiscal expansion agenda will reflate Japan &mdash; remains the dominant positioning theme in the region. The Hang Seng gained 1.8% to 27,027. The Shanghai Composite fell 1.3% to 4,082, weighed by property-sector concerns and mixed signals about the pace of fiscal stimulus in Beijing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>2 &middot; Rates and Central Banks &mdash; The curve is easing, but the Fed isn&rsquo;t</h2>
        <p>
          January CPI came in at 2.4% YoY, a meaningful deceleration from 2.6% in each of the prior two months. The monthly reading was 0.2%, below the 0.3% consensus. Core held at 2.5% YoY. That combination &mdash; headline falling, core stable &mdash; is exactly what the Fed wants to see before moving again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bond market responded accordingly. The 10-year yield dropped to 4.04%, its lowest since early December. The 2-year fell to 3.40%, the lowest since 2022. The 10-2 spread widened to +64 bps, a curve shape consistent with the market pricing rate cuts ahead while long-end supply and term premium keep the back end from rallying as fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fed funds futures now price roughly 61 bps of easing in 2026, up from 58 bps before the CPI report. The CME FedWatch tool shows the market split between a first cut in June and July. The January FOMC held rates at 3.50-3.75%, and Chair Powell gave no forward guidance beyond reiterating data dependence. With Kevin Warsh nominated to replace Powell when his term ends in May, there is an additional layer of policy uncertainty: the market does not know whether Warsh will inherit a rate-cutting cycle or try to establish his credibility by pausing longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Europe, the ECB held all three key rates unchanged on February 5, with the deposit facility at 2.0%. Eurozone CPI fell to 1.7% YoY in January, undershooting the 2.0% target. Core inflation dropped to 2.2%, the lowest since October 2021. Lagarde maintained the &ldquo;meeting by meeting&rdquo; framing, but the data increasingly suggest the ECB risks being too tight. Bank of America expects a final 25 bp cut in March; Deutsche Bank sees no more cuts, with the next move a hike in mid-2027. The divergence in sell-side forecasts reflects genuine uncertainty about whether the eurozone is experiencing a benign disinflation or the early stages of demand destruction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>3 &middot; Currencies and Commodities &mdash; Dollar weakness has legs, gold reprices real yields</h2>
        <p>
          The DXY index held just below 97 on Monday in thin holiday trading. Over the past week, the dollar fell more than 2% against the yen, driven by verbal intervention from Tokyo and the market&rsquo;s expectation that Takaichi&rsquo;s fiscal agenda will eventually force the Bank of Japan to tighten more aggressively. The Australian dollar also gained on hawkish RBA signals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dollar&rsquo;s decline is not a one-week story. The DXY is near multi-month lows, and the structural narrative has shifted: with the Fed on hold and inflation decelerating, the interest rate differential that supported the dollar through 2024 and early 2025 is compressing. Most sell-side year-end forecasts cluster between 92 and 98. The risk is that late Q1 or Q2 brings a tactical dollar bounce if the data push back rate-cut expectations &mdash; but the trend is lower.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gold clearing $5,000 is a statement. The move is driven by three overlapping factors: lower real yields (10-year TIPS breakevens have compressed), continued official-sector buying (China&rsquo;s PBOC added gold for a 15th straight month in January), and geopolitical premium from the US-Iran nuclear negotiations, which resumed in Oman on February 6 and are now set to continue in Geneva. The combination of a weaker dollar, falling real rates, and persistent central bank demand gives gold a bid that is structural, not speculative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oil remains range-bound. Brent at $67.70 and WTI at $62.80 reflect a tug-of-war: January&rsquo;s 1.2 mb/d supply drop from North American winter disruptions tightened the near-term balance, but OPEC+ signaling about resuming gradual output increases starting in April is capping any rally. The IEA forecasts global demand rising 850 kb/d in 2026, with the entire increase coming from non-OECD economies. That is a modest growth picture &mdash; not enough to tighten the market materially if OPEC+ follows through on supply normalization.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>4 &middot; Cross-Asset Implications &mdash; Bonds and gold are telling one story, equities another</h2>
        <p>
          The most important signal last week was the divergence between the bond market and equities. Yields fell across the curve. The dollar weakened. Gold surged. These are all consistent with a market pricing in easier financial conditions ahead. In a normal environment, that combination would support equity valuations &mdash; particularly for growth stocks sensitive to discount rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, the S&amp;P fell 1.4% and the Nasdaq fell 2.1%. The reason is that the equity market is not trading rate expectations right now &mdash; it is trading earnings quality and capex sustainability. The AI trade, which drove the bulk of S&amp;P 500 returns in 2024 and 2025, is being re-examined. Lower yields do not help if the market believes the capex cycle is generating uncertain returns. This is a late-cycle repricing dynamic: the discount rate is falling, but so is the market&rsquo;s confidence in the cash flows being discounted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The regional divergence reinforces this. European and Japanese equities are rallying on their own fundamentals &mdash; valuation, policy, and structural reform narratives &mdash; while U.S. equities are stuck digesting a concentration problem. The Magnificent Seven accounted for most of 2025&rsquo;s S&amp;P return. When those names falter, the index has no fallback, because breadth never fully recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capital is rotating, not fleeing. Money is moving from U.S. megacap tech into European banks, Japanese industrials, gold, and front-end Treasuries. That is not a risk-off move in the traditional sense. It is a rebalancing driven by relative value and the recognition that the U.S. equity premium has gotten too wide.
        </p>

        <h2>5 &middot; What to Watch This Week</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Core PCE (Friday):</strong> The Fed&rsquo;s preferred inflation measure is the week&rsquo;s marquee release. If it confirms the CPI&rsquo;s downward trend, June rate-cut pricing will firm up. A hotter print would force a repricing of the entire easing timeline and likely push yields back above 4.20%.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fed Minutes (Wednesday):</strong> The January FOMC held rates steady, but the minutes will reveal how the committee discussed the CPI trajectory, the labor market, and the timeline for resuming cuts. Look for language about the &ldquo;neutral rate&rdquo; debate and whether any members pushed for cutting sooner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Walmart earnings (Thursday):</strong> The single best read on the U.S. consumer right now. Guidance on discretionary spending, trade-down behavior, and margin pressure from tariffs will move the consumer staples and discretionary sectors. Deere reports the same day and offers a lens on agricultural capex and equipment demand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>US-Iran talks (Geneva, ongoing):</strong> A U.S. delegation including envoys Witkoff and Kushner is heading to meet Iranian officials. The oil market is pricing in a low probability of escalation, but the military buildup (two carrier groups in the region) creates a tail risk. Any breakdown in talks would push Brent above $70 within days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Q4 GDP second estimate:</strong> The revision could adjust the growth picture modestly, but the market&rsquo;s attention has shifted to Q1 2026 tracking estimates. What matters is whether consumption and investment are holding up as rate cuts remain on pause.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <div class="wrap-up">
        <strong>Bottom line:</strong> The bond market is telling you the Fed will cut. Gold is telling you the dollar&rsquo;s decline has further to go. But equities are telling you that lower rates alone are not enough when the earnings narrative is under pressure. This week&rsquo;s core PCE report will either validate the bond market&rsquo;s optimism or force a painful repricing. Until then, the cross-asset divergence is the trade &mdash; and the tell.
