    <h1>AI Anxiety Reloads Risk-Off</h1>
    <div class="meta">By <strong>Hunter William Lang</strong> · FinTrend News · Tuesday, February 16, 2026</div>

    <!-- Executive Summary -->
    <div class="exec-summary">
      <div class="k">Executive Summary</div>
      <p>Tech is getting hit again as AI substitution fears compound a broader rotation out of growth, and with Fed minutes tomorrow and key macro data Friday, there is no near-term catalyst to reverse the selling pressure.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 1: Driver -->
    <h2>1. Driver</h2>
    <p>The primary driver today is <strong>persistent AI substitution anxiety</strong>, which is pressuring the Nasdaq and Mag-7 through capital rotation into value and defensive sectors. Markets returned from the Presidents' Day long weekend where they left off — selling tech. This is not a single-day reaction. Software stocks entered bear market territory two weeks ago, and the rotation accelerating out of high-multiple growth names into industrials, energy, and defensives has been building since late January.</p>
    <p>Contributing to the pressure: General Mills cut its full-year profit forecast citing a consumer that is actively pulling back on household spending. Medtronic, despite beating earnings, guided cautiously on tariff headwinds. These are not isolated data points — they are consistent signals of a consumer that is losing confidence as tariff pass-through hits price levels across categories.</p>

    <div class="alert">
      <div class="k">Today's Macro Context</div>
      <p>January CPI came in at <strong>+2.4% YoY</strong> (headline) and <strong>+2.5% core</strong> — the lowest core reading since April 2021. That should be bullish, but the 10-year yield is already at 4.03%, a two-month low, and stocks are still down. When good data fails to produce a rally, the tape is telling you something.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Confirmation -->
    <h2>2. Confirmation</h2>
    <p>Confirmation appears across multiple vectors, suggesting that this is a genuine risk-off rotation, not noise:</p>
    <p><strong>Yields:</strong> The 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.03% this morning — a two-month low. Falling yields in a down equity session means capital is moving to safety, not being deployed on rate relief.<br>
    <strong>Dollar:</strong> The dollar is up today, consistent with risk-off flows.<br>
    <strong>Volatility:</strong> VIX is elevated and rising. The prior week's reading near 17.7 was flagged as insufficient for a sustained bull run, and the market has confirmed that signal.<br>
    <strong>Breadth:</strong> 63% of S&amp;P 500 stocks remain above their 50-day moving average, meaning the index sell-off is concentrated in mega-cap tech. The equal-weight S&amp;P is holding better than the headline index — this is rotation, not broad distribution. Yet.<br>
    <strong>Sector behavior:</strong> Industrials, energy, and materials are outperforming. High-beta and Mag-7 are underperforming. Six of the seven mega-caps are more than 15% below their all-time highs collectively.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Market Bias -->
    <h2>3. Market Bias</h2>
    <span class="bias-badge">Risk-Off</span>
    <p style="margin-top:14px;">The session is risk-off, concentrated in tech. The broader market is attempting to hold, with the Dow near 49,500 and the S&P 500 oscillating near flat — but the Nasdaq is down 0.2% and struggling to find buyers. Bitcoin remains weak, which has historically preceded broader equity weakness by days to weeks. The 100-day moving average at 6,812 on SPX is the critical line. It held twice on Friday as support. If it breaks and closes below, the structure changes materially.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Key Levels -->
    <h2>4. Key Levels</h2>
    <div class="levels-grid">
      <div class="level-card">
        <div class="ticker">SPX — S&amp;P 500</div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Current</span><span class="value">~6,836</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Support 1</span><span class="support">6,812 (100-day MA — tested twice Friday)</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Support 2</span><span class="support">6,794 (recent week low)</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Resistance 1</span><span class="resistance">6,894 (50-day MA — capped Friday's rally)</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Resistance 2</span><span class="resistance">7,000 (prior breakout level)</span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="level-card">
        <div class="ticker">NDX — Nasdaq 100</div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Current</span><span class="value">~22,546</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Support 1</span><span class="support">22,200 (100-day SMA — prior support now watched)</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Support 2</span><span class="support">21,800 (structural base)</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Resistance 1</span><span class="resistance">22,900 (broken support, now resistance)</span></div>
        <div class="row"><span class="label">Resistance 2</span><span class="resistance">23,500 (prior consolidation zone)</span></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:14px; font-size:14px; color:#9ea3ab;">Note: NDX already lost its 100-day SMA earlier this month. A prior support-turned-resistance dynamic is now in play — rallies to those levels are likely to be sold until the structure repairs.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: Catalyst Watch -->
    <h2>5. Catalyst Watch</h2>

    <div class="panel">
      <div class="k">Events That Can Move the Tape This Week</div>
      <p><strong>Tomorrow — Fed Minutes (Feb 18):</strong> The market will parse language around the rate pause. CPI is at 2.4%, but the Fed's own language around tariff-driven inflation being "transitory" or "structural" will dictate whether June rate cut pricing (currently at 85%) holds. Any hawkish tone pushes yields up and pressures growth stocks further.</p>
      <p><strong>Tonight — Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Earnings:</strong> A bellwether for enterprise cybersecurity spending. Weak guidance here signals that corporate IT budgets are tightening, which is a second-order negative for the entire software sector already in a bear market.</p>
      <p><strong>Friday, Feb 25 — Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings:</strong> The single most consequential earnings report of the quarter. Citigroup flagged expected outperformance in H2 2026 as AI demand visibility extends toward 2027. A miss or weak guidance on data center demand will reaccelerate the AI capex narrative selloff. A beat resets the tone.</p>
      <p><strong>Friday (this week) — Possible Supreme Court Tariff Ruling:</strong> Expectations are for the administration to lose, but market reaction will depend on whether enforcement alternatives are deployed immediately. This is a binary risk event with asymmetric downside if tariff uncertainty escalates.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 6: Risk Scenario -->
    <h2>6. Risk Scenario</h2>
    <div class="risk-panel">
      <div class="k">Risk to This View</div>
      <p>The risk to the risk-off thesis is a <strong>Fed minutes surprise that leans dovish</strong> — specifically, language acknowledging that tariff-driven inflation is temporary and that the committee sees room to cut by mid-year if growth softens. This would spike a short-covering rally in rate-sensitive growth names and lift the NDX back above the 50-day. Additionally, if Palo Alto Networks delivers strong guidance tonight, it would signal that the software bear market is overdone and trigger a rotation back into tech. In that scenario, SPX reclaims 6,894 and the risk-off structure breaks down in the short term.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Closing -->
    <h2>7. Closing</h2>
    <div class="closing">
      For now, momentum favors continued pressure on high-multiple tech and AI infrastructure names — but watch the 6,812 SPX level and tomorrow's Fed minutes closely. A dovish surprise or a strong Palo Alto print could reverse the narrative fast. Until either materializes, the path of least resistance is lower for growth and sideways for the broader index.
