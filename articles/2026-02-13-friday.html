    <h1>Global Markets Note — February 15, 2026</h1>
    <div class="meta">By <strong>William Hunter Lang</strong> · FinTrend News · Daily Macro</div>

    <p>Friday’s tape (Feb 13) looked calm in index terms, but it was not a “nothing day.” The U.S. inflation print loosened the front end of the rates curve, gold reacted like rates traders expected it would, and equities did something more revealing: they stopped paying up for duration and started paying for balance-sheet resilience. The headline closes hid a rotation that matters into quarter-end positioning, especially with U.S. markets closed Monday for Presidents Day.[cite:1]</p>

    <div class="headline">
      <div class="k">Week in One Line</div>
      <div class="b">The market accepted that inflation is cooling — then immediately asked whether that cooling is enough to justify paying premium multiples for cash flows that sit far in the future.[cite:1]</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Structured bullet summary of today’s key market drivers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inflation surprise moved rates pricing, not the whole curve:</strong> a softer January CPI pulled forward the market’s confidence in mid-year easing, compressing front-end term premia more than long-end yields.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Equities treated “lower inflation” as permission to rotate, not to chase:</strong> defensives outperformed while megacap tech lagged, implying investors are still skeptical about near-term earnings visibility in the highest-duration parts of the index.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Europe held up on idiosyncratic support:</strong> the UK benefited from deal activity and rate-cut expectations, while the eurozone stayed mixed as investors calibrated policy stability at the ECB.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Asia weakened into the holiday:</strong> China and Hong Kong fell in thin liquidity ahead of a week-long closure, making price action more sensitive to U.S. tech sentiment.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Gold did exactly what it should when the market prices easier policy:</strong> a non-yielding asset rallied as real-rate expectations eased; oil stayed heavy, consistent with growth expectations drifting lower at the margin.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Dollar stayed firm because the U.S. still offers carry:</strong> even with easier Fed pricing, the U.S. curve remains high versus Europe/Japan, keeping USD supported against JPY and limiting EUR upside.[cite:1]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Equity Markets</h2>
    <p><strong>U.S. closes (Feb 13):</strong> S&amp;P 500 ~6,836 (+0.05%), Nasdaq ~22,547 (-0.2%), Dow ~49,501 (+0.1%).[cite:1] The reason those “flat” numbers are worth attention is that the internal drivers were not flat. The market opened with a clean CPI impulse: lower inflation mechanically lifts the present value of longer-duration cash flows, so you’d expect growth leadership. Instead, the Nasdaq still finished lower while utilities and real estate led.[cite:1]</p>

    <p>That divergence is the tell. It says investors did not treat the CPI as an all-clear for paying any price for long-duration earnings. The drag came from the same place it has all month: large tech and communications names that sit at the intersection of (1) elevated capex commitments and (2) uncertain payback periods. If the market were confident the CPI print meant a straight line to lower real yields, the highest-duration parts of the index would have been bid all day. They weren’t — which implies positioning was already long duration, and the incremental buyer chose “cash-flow now” sectors instead.[cite:1]</p>

    <p>Europe was mixed but resilient. The Stoxx 600 ended roughly flat/down on the day and remains near highs, while the UK’s FTSE 100 closed around 10,434 after another weekly gain, helped by domestic catalysts and rate expectations. Germany’s DAX closed near 24,913 and France’s CAC 40 near 8,312.[cite:1] The European message was simple: markets are willing to hold cyclical exposure, but they want policy to stay predictable. Europe currently looks like a “carry and dividends” trade more than a “multiple expansion” trade.</p>

    <p>Asia, by contrast, looked like a liquidity story. Japan’s Nikkei closed around 56,942 (off its highs), Hong Kong’s Hang Seng around 26,567, and Shanghai around 4,082, with China/HK trading pressured as the region headed into an extended holiday. Thin liquidity makes any overnight U.S. tech wobble transmit more directly into Asia’s index futures and ETFs. That is exactly what happened: U.S. tech unease met a holiday tape, and prices moved more than fundamentals did.[cite:1]</p>

    <h2>2. Rates and Central Banks</h2>
    <p>Start with the mechanical driver: January CPI was softer than expected (0.2% m/m headline; core still firm but not accelerating), and that re-priced the front end toward mid-year easing. Reuters flagged a jump in the probability of a June cut and roughly ~60–65bp of easing priced for 2026 in fed funds futures after the print.[cite:1]</p>

    <p>Now the nuance: the move was larger in expectations than in the long end. The U.S. 2-year yield was roughly mid-3s (~3.5%), while the 10-year sat around ~4.1% in the latest daily series. That keeps the curve modestly positive (10s–2s around +60bp). A curve that stays positively sloped while equities rotate defensively is a specific macro mix: it suggests investors are pricing some policy relief without embracing a new growth acceleration.[cite:1]</p>

    <p>For the Fed, the CPI gives cover to wait. The bar for cuts is not “inflation is lower once,” it’s “inflation is lower while activity data does not re-ignite price pressure.” That is why the front end moved (because the near-term inflation path matters most for the next one or two meetings), but the 10-year didn’t collapse (because the market is not convinced the longer-run equilibrium rate is falling quickly).[cite:1]</p>

    <p>In Europe, the policy contrast is sharper. The ECB held rates unchanged on Feb 5 and has been communicating stability rather than urgency. Market pricing has leaned toward limited moves in 2026, and the ECB’s own language has emphasized medium-term inflation convergence with a “wait and confirm” stance.[cite:1] Translation: Europe is not about to underwrite a growth boom with rapid cuts. That caps upside in European cyclicals and keeps European credit attractive relative to equities, especially for investors who want carry without taking U.S. duration risk.</p>

    <h2>3. Currencies and Commodities</h2>
    <p>The FX tape lined up with the rates message. EUR/USD sat around ~1.186, USD/JPY around ~153.5, and DXY around ~97.[cite:1] Despite softer CPI, the dollar held because relative yield still favors the U.S. The Fed may cut later this year, but Europe is not signaling a rush to ease, and Japan’s policy outlook is still dominated by domestic politics and fiscal expectations rather than a clean pivot to high real rates.[cite:1]</p>

    <p>Commodities made the cross-asset point clearer than equities did. Spot gold jumped back above $5,000 (roughly $5,022/oz), responding to lower expected real rates and renewed confidence that the next policy move is easing, not tightening.[cite:1] That rally is also a positioning story: when gold has recently been volatile, a CPI-driven shift in rate expectations forces systematic and macro portfolios to rebalance quickly because gold’s correlation to real yields is one of the most stable relationships in liquid macro.[cite:1]</p>

    <p>Oil stayed heavy. Brent was around the high-$60s (about $67–68) and WTI around the low-$60s (about $62–63). The simplest interpretation is not “supply shock” — it is demand expectations drifting lower at the margin while OPEC discipline and geopolitical risk are not (yet) creating a sustained upside impulse.[cite:1] When oil fails to rally alongside a gold rally, the market is usually telling you the move is about rates and hedging, not about a growth re-acceleration.</p>

    <h2>4. Cross-Asset Implications</h2>
    <p>Put it together and you get a coherent, investable regime: <strong>rate relief without growth conviction</strong>. The CPI reduced the near-term tail risk of re-acceleration in inflation, so the market pulled forward easing odds. But equity leadership did not shift toward the most rate-sensitive, highest-duration parts of the market. Instead, it rotated toward sectors that benefit from lower yields through financing costs (real estate) and toward sectors where earnings variability is low (utilities).[cite:1]</p>

    <p>That matters for portfolio construction. If you’re long U.S. megacap duration as your core exposure, you’re effectively betting that (1) the Fed cuts, and (2) the market keeps paying a premium for distant cash flows even if capex intensity stays elevated. Friday’s tape said investors are less willing to grant (2) automatically. The “prove it” phase is not a slogan; it is a discount-rate and free-cash-flow problem. Higher capex with unclear payback is a duration extension at the company level — and markets are charging for it.[cite:1]</p>

    <p>In credit, this environment tends to widen the gap between high-quality issuers (who can fund capex without stressing coverage) and marginal balance sheets (who need benign refinancing conditions). In FX, it tends to keep USD supported against low-yielding currencies, because the U.S. still offers carry even when it prices cuts. In commodities, it supports gold more than oil, because the impulse is “real yields down,” not “global demand up.”[cite:1]</p>

    <h2>What to Watch Next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fed communication vs. futures pricing:</strong> if officials push back on the mid-year cut narrative, the front end can reprice quickly, and that would test the rotation into rate-sensitive defensives.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Next U.S. labor prints:</strong> the market can tolerate easier inflation, but not wages that re-accelerate. If wages surprise higher, real yields rise and gold’s CPI-driven rally can reverse fast.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Europe’s growth data and ECB tone:</strong> if Europe stabilizes without easier policy, the euro can stay supported, but European equities may remain a “dividend and quality” story rather than a momentum story.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>China holiday liquidity and reopening gaps:</strong> thin markets exaggerate moves; the first sessions after the closure will tell you whether this was a temporary liquidity air-pocket or a genuine shift in domestic demand confidence.[cite:1]</li>
      <li><strong>Oil’s ability to hold the low-$60s in WTI:</strong> failure to stabilize would be a growth signal, not an inflation signal — and that would reinforce the current defensive tilt in equities.[cite:1]</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The CPI gave the market permission to price cuts again, but equities refused to treat that permission as a reason to extend duration. Until that changes, assume leadership stays closer to cash-flow certainty than to long-dated optionality — and assume cross-asset moves will keep running through the rates complex first, equities second.[cite:1]</p>
