    <p>
      After a multi-week rally, U.S. equities enter the new week stretched, selective,
      and increasingly dependent on catalysts. Markets have pushed near all-time highs,
      but the tone underneath has changed: leadership is shifting away from
      mega-cap tech, the Dow is breaking out, and the rate backdrop remains firm
      enough to matter. With inflation still above target and long yields hovering
      around the 4% zone, this week’s data will shape whether the market finds
      fresh momentum or stalls.
    </p>

    <h2>Market Snapshot</h2>

    <p>
      Last week delivered mixed but revealing action. The S&P 500 sits in the mid-6800s,
      drifting after leadership exhaustion in tech. The Nasdaq has cooled, weighed down
      by profit-taking and stretched positioning. Meanwhile, the Dow has broken above
      48,000—its first major breakout in months—fueled by a shift toward value, quality,
      and balance-sheet strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield holds just above 4.1%, a level that prevents
      financial conditions from easing too quickly even as inflation momentum cools.
      Oil trades in the high-$50s, stabilizing after weeks of softening demand signals
      and improved supply conditions.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      “This is not an all-in risk-on backdrop. It’s a selective, valuation-sensitive market
      that rewards discipline and punishes fragility.”
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      This setup argues for choppy but constructive trading. Strength continues where
      cash flow is reliable and multiples aren’t excessive. High-valuation growth names
      face more asymmetric downside to any macro surprise. Breadth is improving, but
      the rally is fragile.
    </p>

    <h2>This Week’s Macro Calendar — What Matters</h2>

    <p>
      Monday begins with the Empire State Manufacturing Index, providing a real-time look
      at regional activity. While not a market-moving print by itself, it feeds into the
      broader question of whether the slowdown in manufacturing is stabilizing or
      weakening again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Retail sales and producer prices later in the week will be watched closely. Both
      touch the heart of the “soft landing vs. slowdown” debate: is demand cooling
      gently, or is it deteriorating too quickly in the face of higher rates?
    </p>

    <p>
      Internationally, UK and eurozone GDP releases and Canadian CPI offer cues on global
      growth divergence. With the U.S. economy still outperforming peers, any shift in
      relative momentum could reshape FX dynamics and risk appetite.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      A set of benign data keeps the soft-landing narrative alive, supporting equities
      and keeping yields contained. A hot inflation print or strong retail sales number
      reopens the door to renewed rate concerns and hits duration-sensitive stocks first.
    </p>

    <h2>Earnings and Micro Catalysts</h2>

    <p>
      Earnings season has passed its peak, but key reports remain from industrials,
      energy, and logistics names. With valuations stretched in some corners of the
      market, stock-specific reactions are becoming more violent: solid beats with good
      guidance are rewarded, while even small disappointments lead to outsized selling.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      Expect more divergence between winners and losers. Index performance may look calm
      while underneath the surface, individual names swing sharply based on forward
      outlooks.
    </p>

    <h2>Cross-Asset View</h2>

    <p>
      Yields remain elevated but stable, suggesting the bond market sees progress on
      inflation but not enough to justify aggressive rate cuts. The dollar stays firm,
      reflecting U.S. economic resilience. Oil’s stabilization near $58 signals that
      global growth is cooling but not collapsing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Market Impact:</strong>  
      This cross-asset mix supports selective risk-taking but leaves crowded trades
      exposed. Expect defensive positioning beneath the surface even if index levels
      remain firm.
    </p>

    <h2>Base Case and Key Risks</h2>

    <p>
      My base case for the week: range-bound trading with a mild upward bias if data
      cooperate. Breadth is improving, and the Dow’s strength shows markets are finding
      new leadership.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Risk #1: Hot inflation or retail strength.</strong>  
      If this week’s data come in materially above expectations, yields climb and
      growth stocks take the hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Risk #2: A sudden growth scare.</strong>  
      Weak manufacturing or demand data flip the narrative from “soft landing” to
      “slowing too fast.” Cyclicals suffer; defensives outperform.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Risk #3: Policy surprises or Fed pushback.</strong>  
      Hawkish commentary reintroduces rate-path uncertainty and drives broad risk-off.
